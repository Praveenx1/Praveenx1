# 👋 Hi, I'm Praveen M

## 🤖 Robotics | 🛩️ UAV Systems |  ROS |  Product and Industrial Design

I'm a Robotics Engineer passionate about building autonomous systems that bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. With a Master's in Robotics and a Bachelor's in Automobile Engineering, I specialize in end-to-end development of **robots, drones, autonomous vehicles**, and **ROS-based systems**, alongside **mechanical product design**.

##  What I Do

### 🤖 Robotics & ROS Development
- Proficient in ROS1 & ROS2 for real-time robotic control, navigation, and simulation  
- Experience integrating sensors, actuators, and control algorithms using Micro-ROS, STM32, and Python/C++  
- Projects range from **autonomous mobile robots** to Quanser platforms with advanced control loops

### 🛩️ Drone Systems & UAVs
- Building **fixed-wing and multirotor UAVs**, including complete telemetry, mission planning, and GCS integration  
- Working on a fully **indigenous Ground Control Station (GCS)** with MAVLink-based telemetry, hardware interfacing, and user interface

###  Product & System Design
- Designing custom **robot chassis, drone enclosures**, and internal component layouts in Fusion 360  
- Focus on user-centric design for both form and function (ease of maintenance, airflow, modularity)  
- Created inventory systems and QR-tracking apps for real-world lab operations

## 🔍 Core Focus Areas

- 🤖 Robot Software & Firmware (ROS, STM32, Arduino, Micro-ROS)  
- 🧭 Autonomy & Navigation (SLAM, PID, path planning)  
- 🛠️ Drone Platforms (ArduPilot, PX4, Induscopter, MAVLink, GCS)  
- 🎨 CAD & Prototyping (Fusion 360, Blender, 3D printing)  
- 📱 System Utilities (Python apps, Flask tools, QR/CSV-based trackers)
